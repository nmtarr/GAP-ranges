    "In the wildlife-sightings-wrangler code, occurrence points are buffered to account for uncertainty in the location of the individual observed.  Here, the buffered occurrence points (occurrence circles) are spatially compared against the HUC layer in order to determine which HUCs they can be attributed to.  However, a rule about what spatial relationship constitutes agreement (i.e. what hucs the occurrence is \"in\") must be specified because the geoemetries of points are not nested perfectly within hucs.  What rule is appropriate may be case specific and options could include 1) attribute occurrences to hucs that intersect the circle, 2) attribute occurrences to hucs that completely contain the circle, 3) attribute occurrences to hucs containing some proportion of the circle, etc...  \n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, I used a \"proportion in polygon\" method/rule.  the method used was intersection with an error tolerance of 40% during the intersection.  That means that an occurrence was attributed to a HUC when > 60% of the occurrence circle occurred in the HUC.  The figure below illustrates how this plays out: circles are occurrence polygons, blue polygons are hucs, and numbers tell how many occurrences were attributed to the huc.  Note that that huc with 3 occurrences contains 3 small occurrence circles that are identical and therefore appear as one.  A \"min_count\" is applied in the evaluation too so that HUCs with a number of occurrences > than the min_count are considered to indicate agreement.  This is a way to mediate the influence of false positives and other sporadic errors.  min_counts can be set at the species level or evaluation level.\n",
    "\n",
    "After occurrence circles are attributed to HUCs, the results can be recorded in the species' range map table in terms of whether the two data sets agreed and whether they validate the GAP range data for any HUCs. For each evaluation, a column is added for 1) how many records could be attributed to each huc and 2) whether there is agreement at that huc (1 for yes, 0 for no, 'None' for no data for that huc) and 3) whether the GAP range has been validated by the evaluation."
