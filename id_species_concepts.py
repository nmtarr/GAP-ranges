Description: Species-concepts change over time, sometimes with a spatial
component (e.g., changes in range delination of closely related species or
subspecies).  Retrieval of data for the wrong species-concept would introduce
error.  Therefore, the first step is to sort out species concepts of different
datasets to identify concepts that can be investigated.

For this project/effort, individual species-concepts will be identified,
crosswalked to concepts from various datasets, and stored in a table within
a database.

For now, a single species has been manually entered into species-concepts
for development.
